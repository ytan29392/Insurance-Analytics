Insurance Risk Analytics Project


# Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify trends in insurance claims.
- Conduct **A/B hypothesis testing** to detect risk and profit differences by group.
- Build **machine learning models** to predict claim severity and optimize premium pricing.
- Ensure **data versioning and reproducibility** using DVC and GitHub Actions.


# Tasks 1 & 2

The goal is to explore real auto insurance data from South Africa, summarize trends in risk and premiums, and ensure reproducible, versioned workflows using DVC.

## Task Overview

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Clean and summarize data
- Visualize distributions and outliers
- Analyze **Loss Ratio** across key dimensions (Province, Gender, VehicleType)
- Identify patterns in TotalClaims and TotalPremium
- Produce at least 3 key insight visualizations

### Task 2: Data Version Control (DVC)

- Initialize DVC and configure local storage
- Add the raw dataset to DVC tracking
- Push data to a reproducible local remote
- Ensure project is audit-ready and version-controlled
